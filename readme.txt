== Description ==

Casino & Sports Betting Affiliate Auto Ads (CAF) is a free plugin created to make Casino & Sportsbook affiliate marketing easy. You start earning 45%+ commissions on all the customers you refer, and you can negotiate a higher revenue share, a fixed cost per player referred, or even a hydrid deal. The plugin has two main features, enabling automatic advertisements on your site, and enabling shortcodes for custom placement of advertisements. With auto ads you can create popovers, popups, and banner ads with just 1-click and the advertisements are served on your site. The shortcodes are designed to allow you to access and implement a rich library of advertisements with one line of code required to implement it on your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much can I earn? =

The earning potential is unlimited. The more people who click your ads and become online casino customers, the more you make.

= How much do I get paid / What's the commission rate? =

The standard commission starts at a 45% revenue share deal, and is paid for life! Every time that customer generates revenue, you earn commission. You can even negotiate higher commissions over time as you send more and more customers. There's also an option to earn a fixed fee (CPA), per customer referred, or even a hybrid of fixed fee and a percentage commission.
